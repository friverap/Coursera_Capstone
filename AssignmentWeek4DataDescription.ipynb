    "1. Demographic Information from [Zipcode](https://zipcode.org)\n",

    "2. Demographic and Economic Data from [Wikipedia](https://wikipedia.org)\n",

    "\n",
    "First using Folium to show the map of the region.Then creating Pandas DataFrame of collected information from [Zipcode](https://zipcode.org), [Wikipedia](https://wikipedia.org) and [NICHE](https://niche.com) respectively.\n",
    "Using Matplotlib and Seaborn to plot chats to visualize:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Population and demographics profile\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Population change from 2010 to 2019\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Median house value and household income\n",

    "4. Population data comparison from [Zipcode](https://zipcode.org), [Wikipedia](https://wikipedia.org) and [NICHE](https://niche.com)\n",
    "\n",
    "With these, we combine three DataFrame into one DataFrame to summary all information we want to know except for location data, for instance: city, population, public school ratings, median house value and household income, rent, high schools, top local employers, zipcodes (neighborhoods).\n",
    "\n",
    "Print each Zipcode along with the top 5 most common venues from Foursquare. Explore and cluster the neighborhoods using k-means clustering from machine learning library SciKit Learn. Visualize the resulting clusters on regional map with Folium with colored zipcode dots representing different neighborhood category type.\n",
